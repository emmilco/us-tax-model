## Lines

### gift.allowed — Amount from gift.deduction
Status: **AGREE**

## Refusal gates listed by the second transcription

Reported, not judged: the project often refuses before a worksheet is used, on the line that chooses it, which a per-line comparison cannot see.

| line | gates listed | not read by the project's line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gift.allowed | gift.special | - |

## Raw second transcription

```yaml
lines:
  - id: gift.allowed
    printed: "(helper)"
    label: "Deduction allowed for this item or group of similar noncash property, before income limits"
    type: NonNegDollars
    expr: {op: copy, from: gift.deduction}
    refuses: [gift.special]
    note: "Form 8283 does not figure the charitable contribution deduction or apply income limits; it reports the claimed deduction before income limits. The requested result is therefore the supplied before-limit deduction, and groups needing appraisal or other special treatment are outside this tool."
