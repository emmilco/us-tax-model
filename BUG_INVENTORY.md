# Bug inventory

Append-only record of every defect caught in this repository, kept so that
patterns across defects can be seen. Entries are never edited or removed; a
correction to an entry is a new entry that cites it. `check-all` fails if the
committed prefix of this file has changed.

Each entry records: the sequential id; the date; how it was caught (which
check, test, engine or reading); the symptom; the root cause; where the
defect lived; how it was fixed and in which commit; and pattern tags for
later grouping.

## BUG-0001 — Form 1040 line 9 double-counted qualified dividends

- **Date:** 2026-10-16
- **Caught by:** engine differential scout (PolicyEngine-US 2.49.4 and Tax-Calculator 6.8.5 both reported total income 2,000.00 below the project's on fixture `stage5.return.itemized`); confirmed against `sources/2025/f1040.txt` line 80.
- **Symptom:** total income, AGI, taxable income and tax too high by the qualified-dividend amount on every return with qualified dividends.
- **Root cause:** `forms/2025/f1040.yaml`, line `f1040.line9`, summed `f1040.line3a` in addition to `f1040.line3b`. The form text reads "Add lines 1z, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7a, and 8"; line 3a is a component of 3b, not an addend. The line's own label was transcribed correctly while its operand list was not.
- **Why it survived:** the Lean reference evaluator agreed because it reads the same data; mutation testing cannot flag an extra operand that every fixture's recorded expectation already contains; the 17 fixtures with qualified dividends had expectations recorded from the engine; the Stage 5 review packet narrated the owed case as "dividends 3,500.00" where the inputs were 2,000.00 ordinary including 1,500.00 qualified, so the narrative absorbed the error.
- **Fix:** removed `f1040.line3a` from the sum. Eleven anchored fixtures (Stage 1, 3 and 4) had their W-2 box 1 raised by the qualified-dividend amount so their designed taxable income is unchanged; the two Stage 5 whole-return fixtures kept their inputs and had their expectations re-recorded; the Stage 5 review packet arithmetic was corrected; one integration check (`engine/src/integration.ts`) carried the wrong amount owed as a literal and was corrected.
